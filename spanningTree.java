// A spanning tree is defined as a tree-like subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that includes all the vertices of the graph.
// It is a subset of the edges of the graph that forms a tree where every node of the graph is a part of the tree.
// The total number of spanning trees with n vertices that can be created from a complete graph is equal to n^  (n-2).
